## Getting Started with Git

### Setting Up Your Environment

These commands configure your identity and preferences:

- `git config --global user.name "[Your Name]"`  
  Set your username for commits.
- `git config --global user.email "[Your Email]"`  
  Set your email address for commits.
- `git config --list`  
  Display your current Git configuration.

### Starting a Repository
- `git init`  
  Turn a folder into a Git repository.
- `git clone [url]`  
  Copy an existing repository to your local machine.

---

## Tracking and Managing Changes

### Staging and Committing Changes

Prepare and save your changes with these commands:

- `git status`  
  View the status of your working directory and staged files.
- `git add [file]`  
  Stage specific changes.
- `git add .`  
  Stage all changes in the current directory.
- `git commit -m "[message]"`  
  Create a commit with a message describing the changes.
- `git commit --amend`  
  Modify the most recent commit (e.g., to fix a message).

### Removing or Unstaging Changes
- `git restore [file]`  
  Discard changes in a file (unstaged).
- `git restore --staged [file]`  
  Unstage changes while keeping them in your working directory.

---

## Branching and Collaboration

### Working with Branches

Branches allow parallel development:
- `git branch`  
  List all branches.
- `git branch -r`  
  List all remote branches.
- `git branch [branch-name]`  
  Create a new branch.
- `git switch [branch-name]`  
  Switch to a different branch.
- `git checkout [branch-name]`  
  Switch to a specific branch.  
- `git checkout -b [branch-name]`  
  Create a new branch and switch to it in one step.
- `git switch -c [branch-name]`  
  Create a new branch and switch to it.
- `git branch -d [branch-name]`  
  Delete a branch.
- `git branch -D [branch-name]`  
  Force delete a branch.
- `git branch -m [new-branch-name]`  
  Rename the current branch.

### Merging and Applying Changes
Combine changes from branches or commits into your current branch to integrate updates.
- `git cherry-pick [commit-hash]`  
  Apply changes from a specific commit to the current branch.
- `git merge [branch-name]`  
  Merge the specified branch into the current branch.
- `git rebase [branch-name]`  
  Reapply commits from the current branch onto the specified branch to maintain a linear history.
- `git rebase --continue`  
  Resume an interrupted rebase after resolving conflicts.
- `git rebase -i HEAD~N`  
  Start an interactive rebase for the last N commits, allowing you to edit, reorder, squash, or drop commits.
### Pushing and Pulling Changes

Collaborate with others using remote repositories:
- `git remote add origin [url]`  
  Add a remote repository to your project.
- `git push origin [branch-name]`  
  Push local changes from the specified branch to a remote repository.
- `git push -u origin [branch-name]`  
  Push changes to a remote branch and track it.
- `git fetch origin`  
  Download updates from the remote repository without merging them into your current branch.
- `git pull origin [branch-name]`  
  Fetch and merge changes from a remote branch.
---

## Undoing and Modifying Changes

### Reverting or Resetting Commits

These commands help you modify commit history carefully:
- `git revert [commit-hash]`  
  Create a new commit that undoes changes from a specific commit.
- `git reset --soft [commit]`  
  Move the HEAD pointer but keep staged changes.
- `git reset --hard [commit]`  
  Undo commits and discard all uncommitted changes.

---

## **Exploring and Comparing**

### **Viewing Logs and Diffs**

Understand and analyze changes in your repository with these commands:

- `git log --oneline`  
  Display a compact commit history.  

- `git diff`  
  Compare unstaged changes with the most recent commit.  

- `git diff [branch-name]`  
  Compare your current branch with another branch.  

- `git diff commit1..commit2`  
  Compare changes between two commits.  

- `git diff branch1..branch2`  
  Compare the differences between two branches.  

- `git diff --staged`  
  Show differences between staged changes and the last commit.  

- `git diff --cached`  
  Show differences between staged changes and the last commit (same as `--staged`).  

- `git show [commit-hash]`  
  Show the details of a specific commit.  

- `git reflog`  
  Show a log of all reference updates (e.g., branch checkouts, commits, resets, and rebases).

### **Working with Tags**

Use tags to mark important commits:

- `git tag [tag-name]`  
  Create a lightweight tag for the current commit.  

- `git tag -l`  
  List all tags in the repository.  

- `git tag -a [tag-name] -m "[message]"`  
  Create an annotated tag with a message for the current commit.  

- `git tag -d [tag-name]`  
  Delete a tag locally.

## Ignoring Files

### Using `.gitignore`

Control which files Git should ignore:
- Save patterns in `.gitignore`:
  ```plaintext
  # Ignore compiled files
  *.o
  *.class
  ```
  
---

## Stashing Changes

### Temporarily Saving Progress

Stash allows you to save your changes without committing:
- `git stash`  
  Temporarily store your uncommitted changes.
- `git stash apply`  
  Apply the most recent stash without removing it.
- `git stash drop`  
  Delete the most recent stash.
- `git stash clear`  
  Remove all stashes from your repository.
- `git stash -u`  
  Stash tracked and untracked changes.  
- `git stash list`  
  Show saved stashes.
